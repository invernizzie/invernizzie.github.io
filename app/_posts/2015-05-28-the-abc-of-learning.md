# The ABC of learning

Regardless of the field, technology transforms economy and society as a whole. Today, being successful in the professional and business world requires staying up to date with the latest trends. Deciding what to learn has become key to determine professional outcomes. For a surprisingly simple reason: there's just too much going on. Here I explain how I apply the law of the vital few to choose what to dedicate my attention to.

## There's too much to learn

Technology is advancing at an exponential rate. We are fortunate about that. It's doing good all around the world. It's helping health, poverty, safety and economy in ways unimaginablebefore. Yet, it's also raising a whole set of new issues.

A critical one for professionals is that information is produced at a pace we can't keep up with. Not even by staying focused on a single field. Not even trying to be experts at a specialty of such a field. Trying to absorb everything would be useless. Unless we develop knowledge download _a la_ The Matrix, we'd be screwed.

What I haven't mentioned, though, is that all information isn't equal. There is not as much insight in a single case study than in a decade research program encompassing a thousand cases. It's the same logic behind why we read books instead of watching infomercials (I hope so, anyway).

## The grading scale

Classifying new developments and allocating the right amount of time has become crucial.

These days, when faced with a new piece of information, I immediately put it trough an ABC analysis. I need to know its value before diving in. Sound simple, yet it's not an easy habit to build. How many times have you found yourself going in depth with something of little relevance, only to skim through mind boggling stuff later just because you've run out of time to spend learning? It used to happen to me a lot.

# The As
The first thing in my A list, then, is to know how to classify content. It's what this article tries to explain, and I consider it one of my biggest assets. Understanding what knowledge and skills I'll get by learning something, making the assessment a habit and allocating time consequently. And yes, this single most important item in the A list, is a soft skill.

Other stuff in my A list is of the same differentiating nature. It is (or has the potential to be) disruptive. It renders stuff in the B and C lists irrelevant. The only way of doing that is by changing the game.

But how do you know what changes the game? In hindsight, it's pretty simple to detect. To see it coming though, you need to understand value creation in the context of a field. Identify the higher level elements that interact to create value. This is something you can spend your whole career finding out. In too many cases, it's even hard for those who _have found out_ to put it in clear words.

So I concentrate a lot on that lately. My field of expertise is software. What I like the most is its application to disrupt other fields. To drive change in orders of magnitude, not percentage points. A good way of finding out the more meaningful concepts is to look at past revolutions. I take big hits that did change the game, and analyse the factors that provoked change. Change big enough to kick big fish out of the board.

At some point, you start to find patterns. Most of the time, it's too late to apply them to the field where you found them. Still they're usually great candidates for cross polination between industries or scientific research fields. Who would say 3D printers would have a place in cosmetics? Yet L'Oreal is willing to print alive skin to test new products.

The bottomline here is to get ever better at classifying information. Doing it mechanically. While it can take a lot of effort it will also pay back, so it deserves your attention.

## The rest

There's much more than the As and they deserve analysis too.
Disruption is not an everyday matter. That's why the Bs are important: they're the bulk of gained knowledge. And some long tail niches in the C list can become huge hits. For what they're both worth, I'll discuss them pretty soon.
