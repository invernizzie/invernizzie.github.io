## The Bs

Disruptive breaks, however, are not so common. A long time can go by without them in specific fields. In the meantime, it's productive to learn tools and techniques that enable more efficiency.

In any field, wherever you look, there are costs to be lowered. That's money to be made. Hence, advertising for new technology will be misleading. Applying [Amdahl's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law) is a great way of understanding the impact of an efficiency improvement. As an example, whenever you find something along the lines of "cuts design time by 80%", analyse how much impact design time has on the costs you're trying to lower. If design time represents 4% of a theoretical cost structure, you'll only gain 3.2%. So make sure you invest your learning time accordingly, there might be better deals out there.

Of course, because items in the A list appear from time to time, it's not simple to predict how much impact something will have in a new model. However, it's best to try and avoid temptation. You can always learn the new hot stuff _when it gets_ hot.
